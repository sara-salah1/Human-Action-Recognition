# Human-Action-Recognition
Human Action Recognition Using CNN and LSTM 


**Overview**
This project focuses on human action recognition using advanced deep learning techniques, specifically Convolutional LSTM (ConvLSTM) and Long-term Recurrent Convolutional Networks (LRCN). The goal is to accurately classify human actions in video sequences, leveraging both spatial and temporal features.
